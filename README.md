# Documentation and technical content

Besides documenting my own web projects, In the past, I’ve edited and consulted on developer’s API documentation and user manuals. Throughout my career, I’ve written and edited countless articles, tutorials, and technically-oriented blog posts.

I completed API documentation and DITA courses, and authored and maintained style guides and templates.

## Adjust

I created the developer documentation for one of the company's SDKs. On the user-end side, I created documentation for a new feature, and restructured and wrote a fundamental chapter designed to reduce support calls.

My work involved working with a cross-functional team of engineers, product managers, and support experts.

I've also peer reviewed technical content written by teammates, and worked on preparing a combination of markdown templates and VS Code snippets to optimize workflows.

## Manuals and learning materials

- [An overview of relational databases](/assignments/Overview_of_relational_databases.pdf) - sample educational content for a database vendor.
- [A manual for a drone manufacturer](/assignments/Drone_manual.pdf) - sample documentation for an unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) company.

## Project A

I [wrote long-form technical content](https://insights.project-a.com/?s=Ronny+Shani+) and supported the engineering, data, and product teams with developing, editing, and writing technical content.
As part of my responsibilities, I’ve developed and implemented the content strategy for the in-house tech blog. I’ve also co-authored the firm’s style guide and tone of voice, wrote manuals for non-technical users of the site, and created extensive documentation of the custom WordPress theme and plugins I developed.
